🛡️ AI-Enhanced Log Intelligence and Behavioral Analysis System for Web Applications

Intelligent log monitoring and anomaly detection system for identifying brute-force attacks, suspicious login patterns, and reconnaissance activities in web environments.

📌 Overview

Modern web applications generate massive volumes of log data. Traditional log monitoring systems rely on static rules and manual inspection, making them inefficient against evolving attack patterns.

This project introduces an AI-powered log intelligence system that:

Detects brute-force login attempts

Identifies suspicious IP behavior

Flags potential Nmap scanning activity

Performs behavioral anomaly detection

Provides real-time alerting

The goal is to transform raw log data into actionable security intelligence.



🎯 Problem Statement

Existing systems:

Depend heavily on rule-based detection

Generate high false positives

Lack behavioral context

Do not adapt to evolving threats

This project solves these limitations by integrating:

Machine Learning-based anomaly detection

Pattern recognition

Behavioral profiling

Automated alerting mechanisms



🔍 Core Features
1️⃣ Brute Force Detection

Identifies multiple failed login attempts from a single IP

Time-window based threshold analysis

Adaptive thresholding using ML

2️⃣ Suspicious IP Detection

Flags:

High request frequency

Access to sensitive endpoints

Unusual geographic behavior

3️⃣ Nmap Scan Detection

Detects:

Sequential port probing

Abnormal HTTP response patterns

High-speed connection bursts

4️⃣ Behavioral Anomaly Detection

Uses Isolation Forest / ML models

Detects deviation from normal traffic patterns

Identifies zero-day behavior anomalies

5️⃣ Real-Time Alerts

Console alerts

Log file alerts

Email/Telegram notification (extendable)
